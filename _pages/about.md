<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, advised by Professor Liuqin Chen (陈柳青). My research interests include human-AI collaboration, design methodology, and generative AI in creative processes.

Beyond academia, I enjoy staying active through sports, including gym workouts and yoga, as well as exploring nature, such as hiking.
